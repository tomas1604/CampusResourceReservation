Campus Resource Reservation API

# Project Description
The Campus Resource Reservation API is a backend system responsible for managing reservable campus resources. The system tracks and organizes resources such as study rooms, laboratory spaces, equipment, and shared facilities.

Through the API, users will be able to:
- View available resources and their details
- Create, update, and cancel reservations for these resources

The system will not handle:
- Any frontend user interface
- Payment processing or billing
- External notifications beyond basic API responses

This project focuses solely on providing a reliable backend API for reserving and managing campus resources, ensuring that users can interact with the system programmatically and that access rules and data consistency are enforced.
